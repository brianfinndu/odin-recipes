        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A <strong>full</strong> Bee is a <strong>happy</strong> Bee.</p>
        <p>A <strong>snuggling</strong> Bee is a <strong>happy</strong> Bee.</p>
        <p>A <strong>loved</strong> Bee is a <strong>happy</strong> Bee!</p>
        <p>By following those ideas with the ingredients and steps below, you'll have a happy Bee on your hands in no time flat!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>One full meal</li>
            <li>A few mild drinks</li>
            <li>One shared dessert, maximum</li>
            <li>One to two mid-size blankets, minimum</li>
            <li>Five to ten pillows (optional)</li>
            <li>A handful of thoughtful words</li>
            <li>One to two small, heartfelt gifts</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>Note: your Bee will be most satisfied if the following recipe is followed during colder weather.</p>
        <p>However, he will be appreciative nonetheless! Adjust accordingly per weather conditions.</p>
        <p>-</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>The first three items of the recipe should be enjoyed at a semi-local eatery (no more than a 30-minute drive unless the food is particularly exceptional).</p>
                <p>The drinks and dessert should, as you might expect, be utilized over the course of and after the meal, respectively.</p>
                <p>It is perfectly fine for the shared dessert to be located in a different place than the initial meal.</p>
                <p>In the event that a home-cooked meal is preferred, either involve Bee in the process or minimize preparation time. He doesn't like to admit it, but he can be impatient!</p>
                <p>Do NOT permit Bee to do dishes afterwards. Ensure that the following steps are executed with the dishes out of sight.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The following two items should be used to maximize Bee's comfort after the meal.</p>
                <p>The blankets are fairly self-explanatory. Wrap yourselves up in one or both, and rest up or take a catnap.</p>
                <p>Optionally, utilize the pillow in combination with the blankets for a fort!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Snugs and cuddles should be interspersed throughout the first two steps, but they become increasingly important as time passes. The final step should be performed with <strong><em>maximum snugs!</em></strong></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The final two items should be employed after a fair bit of time has passed and a fair amount of conversation has been held. It is important, though not absolutely essential, that both the words and gift(s) feel organically presented rather than forced. In some ways, it may even be found that a certain nonchalance is beneficial in this case!</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>-</p>
        
        <p>If everything was executed well, you should have an absolutely charmed Bee on your hands. <em><strong>Congratulations!</strong></em></p>
