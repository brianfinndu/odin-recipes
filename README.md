I actually have no idea what this project is for! I assume it will have something to do with pages, links, and images.

After completing this project, I came to realize how all of the different HTML tools I'd learned had come together. Linking pages, properly entering elements, and using different features of HTML for specific situations came to life as the website filled with content!

I feel that some of the biggest takeaways from this project for me are:

- Improved understanding and usage of Git and GitHub
- Improved familiarity with the workflow of viewing and manipulating a file through both the browser and the IDE simultaneously
- Improved knowledge of chaining element types (for exaample, putting a series of <p>s inside of an <li> inside of an <ol>)
- Improved understanding of the way lines are represented in a browser

A second go-around allowed me to fiddle around with the styles using CSS. The site certainly looks considerably cleaner now, and it has a more appealing and welcoming aesthetic. There is tons more to learn, but this is a start! This has been an eye-opening exercise that has made me realize that there is a TON to learn here.
