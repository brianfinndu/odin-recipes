        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>We don't recommend making your Bee mad. But if that's what you want, there are lot of great ways to do it!</p>
        <p>The recipe for a mad Bee is short and sweet, and it only requires a few ingredients.</p>
        <p>By the time you're done, you'll have a steaming hot Bee who's ready to smack you. Yowza!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Five mean comments</li>
            <li>Four wins</li>
            <li>Three close calls</li>
            <li>Two greasy stains</li>
            <li>One untuned guitar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>The five mean comments can be spread sparingly throughout the recipe.</p>
                <p>For maximum efficiency, direct at least two towards Captain America: The Winter Soldier.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>All four wins are essential for the completion of the recipe. Utilize them in Smash Bros. Ultimate.</p>
                <p>For additional points, complete the wins as a zoner, ensuring that you never fight from anywhere but the ledge.</p>
                <p>If you can't win as a zoner, store-bought salt as Wario or R.O.B. will be fine.</p>
                <p>All four wins are necesary to set Bee on his spiral.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The three close calls should be in Mario Kart, ideally caused by blue shells.</p>
                <p>If Mario Kart is unavailable, any competitive game will do.</p>
                <p>Whichever game is played, suggest it as an alternative to Smash Bros. after step 2.</p>
                <p>The goal of this step is to give Bee the sense that he is only a tiny step from winning each time.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The two greasy stains should be both uncomfortable to touch and noticeably visible.</p>
                <p>They can be placed anywhere Bee will see them, but the following locations are ideal:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bee's mechanical keyboard</li>
                        <li>Screens of any sort, especially phone or laptop</li>
                        <li>Locations that seem difficult to clean--whether or not they actually ARE difficult to clean</li>
                        <li>The <em>very</em> top of the TV screen</li>
                        <li>Any <strong>white, cream, or other light-colored</strong> shirt</li>
                    </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Top your masterpiece off by strumming an untuned guitar. Even just a bit off will do! He'll hate it!</p>
                <p>Finally, prepare yourself for the whooping of a lifetime. You deserve it!</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
